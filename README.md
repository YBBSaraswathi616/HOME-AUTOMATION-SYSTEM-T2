Description:
 This project involves designing and implementing a Home Automation System using an Arduino Uno and basic electronic components like LEDs and resistors. The system allows users to control household devices such as lights and fans through a simulated smartphone interface using the Arduino Serial Monitor.

In a real-world scenario, platforms like Blynk or MQTT would be used for wireless control via a smartphone or web application. However, for simulation purposes in Tinkercad, the system uses text commands sent via Serial Monitor to control the devices.

Key Features:
Controls multiple devices (light, fan) using simple commands.
Uses LEDs to simulate real devices.
Can be upgraded to IoT platforms like Blynk or MQTT.
Demonstrates the basic concept of smart home automation.

How It Works:
The Arduino receives text commands via the serial monitor.
Based on the command, it turns the corresponding device ON or OFF.
LEDs are used to represent devices â€” light and fan.
Commands like "LIGHT ON" or "FAN OFF" trigger the desired output.
